\section{Course description}\label{course-description}

Stat 216 is designed to engage you in the statistical investigation
process from developing a research question and data collection methods
to analyzing and communicating results. This course introduces basic
descriptive and inferential statistics using both traditional (normal
and \(t\)-distribution) and simulation approaches including confidence
intervals and hypothesis testing on means (one-sample, two-sample,
paired), proportions (one-sample, two-sample), regression and
correlation. You will be exposed to numerous examples of real-world
applications of statistics that are designed to help you develop a
conceptual understanding of statistics. After taking this course, you
should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand and appreciate how statistics affects your daily life and
  the fundamental role of statistics in all disciplines.
\item
  Evaluate statistics and statistical studies you encounter in your
  other courses.
\item
  Critically read news stories based on statistical studies as an
  informed consumer of data.
\item
  Assess the role of randomness and variability in different contexts.
\item
  Use basic methods to conduct and analyze statistical studies using
  statistical software.
\item
  Evaluate and communicate answers to the four pillars of statistical
  inference: How strong is the evidence of an effect? What is the size
  of the effect? How broadly do the conclusions apply? Can we say what
  caused the observed difference?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MUS STAT 216 learning
outcomes}\label{mus-stat-216-learning-outcomes}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand how to describe the characteristics of a distribution.
\item
  Understand how data can be collected, and how data collection dictates
  the choice of statistical method and appropriate statistical
  inference.
\item
  Interpret and communicate the outcomes of estimation and hypothesis
  tests in the context of a problem.
\item
  To understand the scope of inference for a given dataset.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CORE 2.0}\label{core-2.0}

This course fulfills the Quantitative Reasoning (Q) CORE 2.0 requirement
because learning probability and statistics allows us to disentangle
what's really happening in nature from ``noise'' inherent in data
collection. It allows us to evaluate claims from advertisements and
results of polls and builds critical thinking skills which form the
basis of statistical inference. Students completing a Core 2.0
Quantitative Reasoning (Q) course should demonstrate an ability to:

Interpret and draw inferences from mathematical models such as formulas,
graphs, diagrams or tables. Represent mathematical information
numerically, symbolically and visually. Employ quantitative methods in
symbolic systems such as, arithmetic, algebra, or geometry to solve
problems.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{Course materials and
resources}\label{course-materials-and-resources}

\subsubsection{Online textbook and
coursepack}\label{online-textbook-and-coursepack}

Two ``textbooks'' are required for this course:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/}{\emph{Montana
  State Introductory Statistics with R}} --- our free, online textbook
\item
  STAT 216 Coursepack--- available for free on Canvas or you can
  purchase from the MSU Bookstore
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{RStudio}\label{rstudio}

We will be using the statistical software
\href{https://www.r-project.org/}{R} through the IDE
\href{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/}{RStudio} for data
visualization and statistical analyses.

You will access this software through the MSU RStudio server:
\href{https://rstudio.math.montana.edu/}{rstudio.math.montana.edu}. Your
username is your 7-character NetID (in the form x\#\#x\#\#\#, where x is
a letter and \# is a number), and your password is the password
associated with your NetID. Your email address will not work to log in
to the RStudio server. \textbf{Note: Your NetID password expires every
180 days. To avoid losing access to RStudio server, please
\href{https://pwreset.montana.edu/react/}{reset your NetID password}
BEFORE the first day of your summer session}

See the
\href{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/\#stat-computing}{Statistical
Computing} section in the Welcome chapter of our textbook for
alternative options for accessing RStudio.

\subsubsection{Required course software}\label{required-course-software}

All students are required to have a word processor and spreadsheet
software installed on the personal device they plan to use for this
course. We \emph{highly} recommend the use of Word and Excel. If you do
not currently have Word and/or Excel installed on your device, you can
download the Microsoft Office 365 for Students for free by following the
instructions
\href{https://coe.montana.edu/it/students/student-software.html}{here}.

\subsubsection{Learning management
tools}\label{learning-management-tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://ato.montana.edu/canvas/}{\textbf{Canvas}}: Find your
  instructor contact info, announcements, instructor notes, exam review
  material, assignment and activity data and R files, discussion forums,
  gradebook.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Important}: Make sure you are receiving email notifications
    for any Canvas activity. In Canvas, go to your Profile, then
    Notifications. There you can enable your notification settings,
    including what notifications you want sent to your personal email
    for each class you are enrolled in.
  \item
    If you have a question about the course materials, computing, or
    logistics, please post your question to your Canvas discussion board
    instead of emailing your instructor. This ensures all students can
    benefit from the responses. Other students are encouraged to
    respond.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{\textbf{Gradescope}}: Submit and
  review assignments, labs and exam grades. For more details, see our
  links in D2L under Content --\textgreater{} Primary Resources
  --\textgreater{} Gradescope Help
\item
  \href{https://math.montana.edu/undergrad/msc/}{\textbf{Math and Stat
  Center}}: Free drop-in tutoring for 100- and 200-level math and stat
  courses.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{Course format and
organization}\label{course-format-and-organization}

This is an online course. This perhaps obviously means we will never
meet in person. That greatly changes your role as a student as well as
ours as instructors.

\subsubsection{Weekly Expectations}\label{weekly-expectations}

Each week, online students will be expected to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{read} assigned sections of the textbook and \textbf{watch
  videos} on that week's content,
\item
  complete \textbf{notes} on the readings/videos in the coursepack and
  upload to \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope}, along with
  answering a few questions on the readings/videos
\item
  complete 4+ \textbf{activities or labs} in the coursepack and upload
  to \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope},
\item
  complete 1 \textbf{assignment} in
  \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Online Instructor's Role}\label{online-instructors-role}

Most of the communication in the course should be done using the Canvas
Discussion and Chat tools. Personal questions you may have can be
emailed to your instructor using the Chat option or by sending an email
to the email address listed above. Your instructor will check email
periodically, and try to respond to emails as promptly as possible if
the email is received during usual daytime or early evening hours.
Office hours will be the best way for live-streaming Q\&A.

Questions on course material can be posted in the appropriate Discussion
folders for that topic. Responses from your instructor to those
questions will be posted as a response to that Discussion posting. You
are encouraged to post questions on course material in the Discussion
folder so that everyone may benefit from the responses! You can post
questions and respond to each other's questions. It honestly helps to
try to explain things to each other instead of waiting for the
instructor's responses, as trying to explain things out loud helps us
learn even if the answer is not correct! We all have a voice in an
online learning environment! If you wish to communicate with peers
within D2L to discuss homework questions and the like, any messages you
send privately to each other are not seen by course instructors. You may
even view the People tool and email other members of the course to ask
questions or simply to generally communicate. Only what is posted in
Discussions is available for everyone to see.

\subsubsection{Online Student's Role}\label{online-students-role}

It is important for you to understand that your role in this class is
not to be a passive note taker because there is no lecture in which to
take notes! Each of you is expected to read and understand the material
in the text, work on the homework problems, complete all assigned work,
and ask questions about concepts you do not understand (and hopefully
answer a few questions about the concepts you do understand) in the
discussion section of the course. Simply reading the words in the text
without comprehension, guessing your way through the assigned work, or
looking at the solutions to the homework and thinking you understand how
to do the problem is a waste of time and a sure way to fail the course.
Your instructor will answer your questions but you have to learn the
material on your own. In this class, more than any other course you have
taken, you are responsible for your education.

\emph{Note}: The proper way to learn material presented in this course
is to read the chapter, watch the videos, complete the video notes and
video quiz, work through the activities, and then complete all assigned
work on your own. Don't rely only on the feedback to learn the material.
Learning in this way will not train you to think independently, and may
show you how to do one particular problem, but you will not be able to
read another problem and be able to solve it. Point being: statistics is
about understanding all aspects of an idea presented, not just a
systematic way of using a formula. In other words, this is NOT a math
class!

\subsubsection{Group Expectations}\label{group-expectations}

Our use of groups in this course is based on educational research which
provides strong evidence that working in groups is effective and helps
us learn. Additionally, you will build team skills that employers look
for when hiring. By expressing your opinions and catching each other's
mistakes, you will learn to communicate statistical concepts. These are
partly ``common sense'' ideas (for instance, gathering more data
provides a better foundation for decision making), but they are often
phrased in odd ways. We find it really helps to talk about them with
others.

\section{Course assessment}\label{course-assessment}

Your grade in STAT 216 will contain the following components.

\includegraphics{index_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Video Notes and Quizzes
(10\%)}\label{video-notes-and-quizzes-10}

You will be expected to complete the assigned textbook reading and watch
assigned videos prior to completing the activities and labs for each
module. Each video will discuss the reading content and walk you through
one or more examples for each section. Treat these videos as your
lecture on the textbook section, meaning you should actively be taking
notes while watching the videos. Guided video notes are provided in the
coursepack linked in Canvas, or you can take your own notes on the
videos. Concept check quiz questions will be completed in Gradescope and
you will also upload a PDF of your notes to these concept check quizzes.
\emph{(Note that you can rewind/review the video as much as you like,
and may submit your Video Quiz in Gradescope as many times as you like
up through the due date. You can also check your snwers in Gradescope
after submitting (prior to the due date) by clicking on each question's
hyperlink. If a explanation appears, that means you answered the
question correctly.)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All videos are linked in Canvas and video quizzes will
  \emph{typically} be due each \textbf{Tuesday 11:59 pm MST}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Activities and Labs (15\%)}\label{activities-and-labs-15}

Activities and Labs are located within the Stat 216 coursepack. You will
need to work through the assigned activity or lab on your own or with
other students. Please utilize office hours for help completing the
activities and labs

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Select question(s) from each activity and lab will be turned into
  \href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope} to be graded for
  correctness, along with a PDF copy of the completed activity/lab which
  will be graded for correctness.
\item
  Activity/labs will \emph{typically} be due in each \textbf{Tuesday at
  11:59 pm MST}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assignments (20\%)}\label{assignments-20}

You will complete weekly assignments in
\href{https://www.gradescope.com/}{Gradescope}. These should be
completed individually (meaning all answers should be written in your
own words), but you may use your classmates, tutors, or your
instructor/co-instructor/TA for assistance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Weekly assignments will be due each \textbf{Wednesday at 11:59 pm
  MST}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Midterm exam (20\%)}\label{midterm-exam-20}

There will be one midterm exam, \textbf{which must be taken with a
testing center}. Most universities/colleges offer testing services (for
a fee). If you are in Bozeman on the date of the midterm exam, we will
offer proctoring services for free. Please see Canvas for times and
locations available at Montana State to complete your midterm exam.
\textbf{Exams must be taken on the scheduled date. You are responsible
for arranging your schedule to accommodating taking of exams and
setting.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will need to schedule a proctoring appointment on your own to take
  the midterm exam. You will need to email your instructor the name and
  email address of the proctoring center where you will be taking your
  exam \emph{at least 5 days in advance of the exam date!}
\item
  You will be allowed 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete your midterm
  exam.\\
\item
  You will be allowed a calculator (any type) and one (1) sheet of notes
  (8.5 by 11in, front and back, handwritten only).
\item
  You will be provided a formula sheet as well.
\item
  Summer Session I: Midterm Exam on Monday, June 9th
\item
  Summer Session II: Midterm Exam on Monday, July 21st
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Final exam (25\%)}\label{final-exam-25}

Your final exam \textbf{must be taken with a testing center}. Most
universities/colleges offer testing services (for a fee). If you are in
Bozeman on the date of the final exam, we will offer proctoring services
for free. Please see Canvas for times and locations available at Montana
State to complete your final exam. \textbf{Exams must be taken on the
scheduled date. You are responsible for arranging your schedule to
accommodating taking of exams and setting.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will need to schedule a proctoring appointment on your own to take
  the final exam. You will need to email your instructor the name and
  email address of the proctoring center where you will be taking your
  exam \emph{at least 5 days in advance of the exam date!}
\item
  You will be allowed 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete your final
  exam.\\
\item
  You will be allowed a calculator (any type) and two (2) sheets of
  notes (8.5 by 11in, front and back, handwritten only).
\item
  You will be provided a formula sheet as well.
\item
  Summer Session I: Midterm Exam on Thursday, June 26th
\item
  Summer Session II: Midterm Exam on Thursday, August 7th
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Group Project (10\%)}\label{group-project-10}

The project project will be completed in parts working with 2-3 other
classmates. You will be required to submit a research question and data
collection plan, collect the data, and complete both a descriptive and
inferential analysis of the data. You will turn in one project component
per group each \textbf{Friday at 11:59 pm}.
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M-uz_NFvCF685WA9Gm4wZMDITWx1aRr5bYMWaMVGZNU/edit?usp=sharing}{Detailed
instructions, due dates, and rubrics for each project component are
available here.}

\emph{Plan ahead}: A 3-credit course over a 6 week summer session is
expected to account for 75 minutes each day, 5 days per week of
instructional time. This is the amount of time you should plan to spend
reading and taking notes on the textbook, watching and taking notes on
the videos, and attending synchronous learning sessions and office
hours. Additionally, our experience shows that an additional 15 to 22
hours per week of a 6 week course is required to obtain a good grade in
this class. By ``good'' we mean at least a C because a grade of D or
below does not count toward fulfilling degree requirements. Many of you
set your goals higher than just getting a C, and we fully support that.
You need roughly 20 to 25 hours per week to review past activities, read
feedback on previous assignments, complete current assignments, and
prepare for the next week's class.

\subsubsection{Late work policy}\label{late-work-policy}

In general, make-up exams or late homework
assignments/quizzes/activites/labs will not be allowed. Case-by-case
exceptions may be granted in only extreme cases at the discretion of the
instructor. You must speak to your instructor on or before the due date
or exam date and provide documentation explaining your absence for the
instructor to determine whether an exception should be granted. If you
fail to provide documentation as requested then you will not be able to
make-up missed work at all.

\subsubsection{Letter grades}\label{letter-grades}

Final course grades will be determined according to the following scale.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Letter Grade & Weighted Score \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
A & 93-100\% \\
A- & 90-92.99\% \\
B+ & 87-89.99\% \\
B & 83-86.99\% \\
B- & 80-82.99\% \\
C+ & 77-79.99\% \\
C & 70-76.99\% \\
D & 60-69.99\% \\
F & \textless59.99\% \\
\end{longtable}

The grade cutoffs may be shifted \emph{downward} at the end of the
semester based on student performance (never upward).

\section{Diversity and inclusivity}\label{diversity-and-inclusivity}

Respect for Diversity: It is our intent that students from all diverse
backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that
students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race,
religion, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics.
Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this
course are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to
improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other
students or student groups.

In addition, in scheduling exams, we have attempted to avoid conflicts
with major religious holidays. If, however, we have inadvertently
scheduled an exam or major deadline that creates a conflict with your
religious observances, please let us know as soon as possible so that we
can make other arrangements.

Support for Inclusivity: We support an inclusive learning environment
where diversity and individual differences are understood, respected,
appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. We expect that
students, faculty, administrators and staff at MSU will respect
differences and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other
peoples' perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from
their own.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{Policy on academic
misconduct}\label{policy-on-academic-misconduct}

Students in an academic setting are responsible for approaching all
assignments with rigor, integrity, and in compliance with the University
Code of Student Conduct. This responsibility includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  consulting and analyzing sources that are relevant to the topic of
  inquiry;
\item
  clearly acknowledging when they draw from the ideas or the phrasing of
  those sources in their own writing;
\item
  learning and using appropriate citation conventions within the field
  in which they are studying; and
\item
  asking their instructor for guidance when they are uncertain of how to
  acknowledge the contributions of others in their thinking and writing.
\end{enumerate}

When students fail to adhere to these responsibilities, they may
intentionally or unintentionally ``use someone else's language, ideas,
or other original (not common-knowledge) material without properly
acknowledging its source'' \url{http://www.wpacouncil.org}. When the act
is intentional, the student has engaged in plagiarism.

Plagiarism is an act of academic misconduct, which carries with it
consequences including, but not limited to, receiving a course grade of
``F'' and a report to the Office of the Dean of Students. Unfortunately,
it is not always clear if the misuse of sources is intentional or
unintentional, which means that you may be accused of plagiarism even if
you do not intentionally plagiarize. If you have any questions regarding
use and citation of sources in your academic writing, you are
responsible for consulting with your instructor before the assignment
due date. In addition, you can work with an MSU Writing Center tutor at
any point in your writing process, including when you are integrating or
citing sources. You can make an appointment and find citation resources
at www.montana.edu/writingcenter.

\textbf{ In STAT 216, assignments that include the same wording as
another student, regardless of whether that student was cited in your
sources, will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as such.
Students involved in plagiarism on assignments (all parties involved)
will receive a zero grade on that assignment. The second offense will
result in a zero on that assignment, and the incident will be reported
to the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct on an exam will result in a

\section{Policy on the use of AI language models}\label{AI}

In this course, you may utilize generative AI language models, including
ChatGPT, as a resource to support your work outside of class (during
class, you should seek assistance from group members or instructors). AI
language models are powerful tools developed to generate text based on
the input provided. \textbf{While the AI language models can help refine
your writing and coding, it is important to remember that it is an AI
system and not a substitute for your critical thinking and creativity.
Due to the nature of statistics and this course, an AI-generated answer
may be incomplete, overly complex, or even incorrect.} If you do not
understand a concept or a question asked, we \emph{highly} recommend
visiting the \href{https://math.montana.edu/undergrad/msc/}{Math and
Stats Center}, emailing or visiting with a member of your instructional
team, or using the search feature within the online textbook before
turning to Google or AI.

If you choose to use this tool, apply it as a supplement and do not rely
solely on its suggestions. Ultimately, you are responsible for the
content and quality of your work. Therefore, you should critically
evaluate ChatGPT outputs for accuracy, potential bias, and relevancy.
When utilizing AI language models, it is essential to ensure that your
writing and coding remains original and properly attributed, including
citing outputs or text generated by ChatGPT. \textbf{If you choose to
use AI language models to assist you on labs or assignments, you must
cite the source used. Failure to do so will result in earning a 0 on all
problems in which AI language models usage has been detected.}

Please see the How to cite ChatGPT in MLA Style
\href{https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/}{resource}. We
encourage you to use AI language models to enhance your writing and
coding skills, experiment with its capabilities, and learn from its
suggestions. If you have any questions or concerns regarding using AI
language models for assignments, please discuss them with us.
